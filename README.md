A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands 

for a UNIX-based operating system. It is called a shell script because 

it combines a sequence of commands, that would otherwise have to be typed 

into the keyboard one at a time, into a single script. and  helps in doing

work which is repetitive in nature. For example: When executing a bunch of
 
commands, often, shells can take all these commands directly from a stored file 

and execute it, instead of writing them again every time. They are used to
 
get routine backups by admins.
